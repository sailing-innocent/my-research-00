# Libs.SAIL

I am going to build up my personal library SAIL to support my daily learning.

SAIL can be used for:

- algorithm update
- idea testing
- data visualisation


提供可视化功能

 `sail::vis::window`

simu: simulation library

optim: optimizatino library

vis: visualizatino library

math: personal math utitlity

engine: game engine scratch

graphics: graphics library

communi: io & communication library

data: data storage, sync and anlaysis library

algo: algorithm and data strcuture library

## TESTING

sail is a pure utility library and will not provide with any executable. Thus we can use /test to execute the unit test.
